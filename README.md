# CS400_FALL2020
Short Term Memory Test

This repository is for CS400 and stores all projects in that course.

The website is for short term memory test. Notice the server is currently not running, so you should use your local environment for testing. I recommend to use Apache or Tomcat.

You might want to create your own test data and use it as you wish.
